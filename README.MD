# University Ride-Sharing Platform - README

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a comprehensive university ride-sharing system consisting of a web-based admin panel and a mobile application. The system facilitates convenient transportation for students and staff within the university campus.

## Features

### Users (Students & Staff):

- **Registration and Authentication:** Users can securely register and log in to the system.
- **Profile Management:** Users can manage their profiles, including personal information and preferences.
- **Ride Booking:** Users can search, filter, and book rides according to their preferences and schedules.
- **Real-time Ride Tracking (Optional):** Users can track rides in real-time using the mobile app.
- **Notification System:** Users receive notifications about ride updates, booking confirmations, and other relevant information.
- **Rating and Review (Optional):** Users have the option to rate and review drivers based on their experiences.

### Drivers:

- **View Assigned Rides:** Drivers can view the rides assigned to them, along with passenger details and routes.
- **Passenger Tracking:** Drivers can track passengers' locations and manage ride progress.
- **Notification System:** Drivers receive notifications about new ride assignments, updates, and other relevant information.
- **Profile Management:** Drivers can manage their profiles, including personal information and vehicle details.

### Admin Panel:

- **User Management:** Admins can manage users, including registration approval, suspension, or deletion.
- **Driver Management:** Admins can perform background checks, verify vehicles, and manage driver profiles.
- **Car Management:** Admins can add, edit, or delete car details from the system.
- **Route Management:** Admins can create and modify routes for the ride-sharing system.
- **Ride Scheduling:** Admins can set schedules for rides, ensuring efficient transportation services.
- **Report Generation:** Admins can generate reports on user activity, ride statistics, and system performance.
- **Notification System:** Admins can send notifications to users and drivers regarding system updates, policy changes, or other announcements.

## Technology Stack

### Mobile App:

- **Framework:** React Native, similar cross-platform frameworks.
- **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Maps Integration (Optional):** Google Maps, Apple Maps, or similar mapping services.
- **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or similar services for real-time notifications.
- **Payment Gateway (Optional):** Integration with Stripe, PayPal, or similar platforms for secure payment processing.

### Admin Panel:

- **Framework:** Django, Spring Boot, or similar web frameworks for backend development.
- **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing administrative data.
- **Deployment:** Secure cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or similar services for hosting the admin panel.

## Security Measures

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementation of secure authentication mechanisms to protect user accounts and data.
- **Data Encryption:** Encryption of sensitive data such as passwords and payment information to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Regular Updates:** Continuous updates to the software to address security vulnerabilities and improve system stability.
- **Penetration Testing:** Regular penetration testing to identify and address potential security weaknesses in the system.

## Note

- This README provides a high-level overview of the project. Detailed technical documentation will be developed during the implementation phase.
- Testing strategies will be crucial to ensure the reliability and functionality of the ride-sharing platform.
- Scalability considerations will be incorporated to accommodate future growth and increased user demand.
